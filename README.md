# # Portfolio Projects

Goal:
Develop a predictive model for blueberry yield using Ridge Regression to address multicollinearity and meet regression assumptions.

Code:[https://github.com/akilasiva93/Blueberry_Yield.git](https://github.com/akilasiva93/Blueberry_Yield.git)

Description:
In this project, my goal was to predict blueberry yield accurately while addressing multicollinearity among predictor variables. After conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and assessing the data for linearity and homoscedasticity, I implemented various regression models. Ridge Regression emerged as the most suitable model due to its ability to handle multicollinearity effectively.

I meticulously examined regression assumptions to ensure the reliability of our model and invested time in visualizing the data to gain deeper insights. The project's focus on data EDA and rigorous model evaluation aimed to enhance the accuracy of our blueberry yield predictions.

Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data EDA, Correlation Matrix(Heat Map), Data Visualizations, Regression Techniques
Technology: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy, sklearn

Results:
Utilizing Ridge Regression, I achieved a significantly improved predictive accuracy for blueberry yield, effectively addressing multicollinearity concerns. The thorough examination of regression assumptions and comprehensive data exploration were pivotal in enhancing the reliability of our predictive model.
